                <h2>David Bowie's career highlights</h2>
        <h3>1960s</h3>
        <p>Bowie's birth name was David Robert Jones and he was born on January 8,
          1947 in Brixton, South London. He renamed himself in 1966 to avoid
          confusion with the lead singer of U.S. rock band, The Monkees.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>1970s</h3>
        <p>Bowie adopted the persona of Ziggy Stardust in the 1970s. The alter ego
          proved an instant classic and the one for which he is most remembered.
          "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars" came to
          define the glam rock era in the U.K. and launched Bowie into the
          global spotlight. Bowie was at the time signed to RCA records and had
          made his first trip to the U.S.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Mid-1970s</h3>
        <p>The rock legend's music became increasingly soulful and by the
          mid-1970s he had established himself in the U.S., bolstered by his
          world tours. His single "Fame" in 1975 became his first
          number one single in the States.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Thin White Duke</h3>
        <p>His next persona had Bowie impeccably dressed in a white shirt,
          black trousers and waistcoat. After recording his "Station to Station"
          album as The Thin White Duke, his drug use and deteriorating health saw
          him relocate from Los Angeles to West Berlin. The following years of
          isolation saw him collaborate with legendary producers Brian Eno and
          Tony Visconti, and rock singer Iggy Pop, and spawned the smash
          hit "Heroes."</p>
